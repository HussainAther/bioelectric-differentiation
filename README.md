# Bioelectric Differentiation

## Overview

This project aims to simulate bioelectric fields and their role in embryonic differentiation. Bioelectric signaling plays a crucial role in cell fate decisions, tissue formation, and regenerative medicine. Understanding these bioelectric gradients could lead to new AI models, biomedical applications, and insights into morphogenesis.

## Key Research Questions

- **How do bioelectric fields influence cell differentiation in embryos?**
- **Can voltage-gated cell states be modeled as computational networks?**
- **Are bioelectric differentiation waves similar to reaction-diffusion systems?**
- **How can bioelectric principles be applied to neural networks and AI?**
- **Can we simulate bioelectricity-driven self-organization in development?**

## Computational Modeling Approaches

1. **Reaction-Diffusion Models**  
   Simulate bioelectric gradients like Turing patterns and track voltage propagation across cell membranes.

2. **Agent-Based Models**  
   Simulate cells as agents responding to bioelectric cues, changing state based on bioelectric potential.

3. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & AI**  
   Model bioelectric activity as a graph network and apply it to self-organizing AI architectures.

4. **Multiscale Simulations**  
   Combine biochemical signaling with bioelectric modeling, integrating membrane voltage, ion flow, and tissue-scale effects.

## Biological Relevance & Applications
